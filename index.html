		<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
			<article>
			<p>My interest in IT started at the ripe age of 6 or so. When my father built our first computer from spare parts and taught me DOS. I don’t remember which version of DOS it may have been. It was a wonderous time of playing games like Alien Carnage, Doom and Command and Conquer. While I did enjoy the gaming, I also had to learn to use DOS commands. I believe this is what really sparked my interest in computers and IT. I have been interested in computers ever since. This led me into building my own computers and working out how all the parts fit together and what they all were.</p>
			<p>I have been doing my own study and work in the background on computers including learning SQL as I started a new role at my company. The role requires me to create SQL reports from the Oracle database and supply them to the necessary staff. I found learning SQL very interesting and decided to look into a university degree. After looking at what was available, I decided that a Bachelor of Information Technology was the right starting degree for me. I discussed this with a fellow colleague and they agreed and suggested RMIT would be best for me to study at. I would like to learn anything which would improve my performance in my new role. I’m particularly interested in developing programming skills and learning other programming languages as I can see myself implementing some kind of system or automating tasks to make my work life easier.</p>

		<h1>Ideal Job</h1> 
			<article>
			<p>The position IT Manager for u&u. Recruitment Partners is a role that involves identifying key issues and future innovation opportunities that could affect or increase business performance. The role reports to the Chief Information Officer. (It Manage Position, n.d.)</p>
			<p>I like the idea of progressing through my current role and growing into an IT Manager as I working with others and getting to know them. I also like to understand the detail of how businesses work in order to help them grow.</p>
			<p>Key responsibilities of the IT Manager include leading a small team as well as leading major projects. The IT Manager is also responsible for maintaining all computer-based infrastructure including Windows, Azure, VMWare and SQL as well as server-based infrastructure like Cisco and Dell hardware. Lastly, the IT Manager is also responsible for managing all third-party vendor relationships including negotiating the best deals for the company, and monitoring all trends and developments across relevant technologies to ensure all innovation opportunities are evaluated.</p>
			<p>For this position of IT Manager, you require a minimum of 5 years management experience leading any team. Experience with most hardware and software is also required in order to best evaluate business needs and prepare workflows in order to align with current business practises. Additionally, a successful candidate will have great interpersonal, negotiation and customer service skills in order to successfully manage all projects and vendors within given timeframes and budgets with the ability to manage up. Lastly you must be a mature and positive member of the company who is passionate about helping others.</p>
			<p>Currently I can maintain most hardware and am comfortable working with databases. I also have a good ability to listen and adapt to a changing environment. I already manage up in my current role and have led a small team of engineers in the past.</p>
			<p>Finishing the Bachelor of IT would fill a lot of the knowledge gaps I currently have in the programming and networking areas of IT. Getting a Master’s degree in IT would also greatly help me build up my IT knowledge even further.</p>

		<h1>Idea project.</h1>
			<article>
			<h2>Photofessional</h2>
			<p>A mobile application that teaches photographers how to improve their photographs in a given situation. The application intelligently compares the current view through the mobile device’s camera lens with a resource pool of professional quality photos to determine the best possible settings for the photographer to use on a DSLR camera.</p>
			<h2>Photofessional,</h2> 
			<p>A mobile app that teaches you to take the best possible photo after recommending changes to your DSLR camera’s settings. The best possible settings are determined by comparing the environment captured by the mobile device and a database of photos. Professional photographs and the photographer’s self-reported settings are to be loaded into a database connected to the app. The app would then display the settings on the screen for the DSLR after you take an example photo with the mobile device. Improved settings will allow you to achieve the same quality or similar quality to the professional photographer.</p>
			<p>I personally am an amateur photographer and love to take photos, however they never turn out as I want them to because I don’t yet understand enough about the settings on the camera. I am sure the world is full of people like me who don’t have the time to play with the camera settings every day to learn them. We just wish to take the best photo possible without the stress of taking 100 photos with different settings and choosing the best or processing the photo after the fact. Post processing itself can take a long time to bring the colours out or to make sure that the main feature stands out enough so that the photo doesn’t look bland.</p>
			<p>The app would allow you to take a quick happy snap of the selected area where you would like your final photo to be. Then the application would compare the photo to other photos in the database and show you five similar photos. You as the user would then select the scene closest to what you envision your ideal photo to look like and the application would then display the settings on the screen of your mobile device for you to copy on your camera. At this point it would still be possible to easily jump between the settings on all five of the similar photos for each of use. This would sadly not guarantee the best possible photo but it would also help you learn how the settings affect the type of photo you take based on the scene and the light available, effectively teaching you how to take the best photo due to the feedback the application gives.</p>
			<p>The operation of this app would be very simple:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Select the time of day (which affects the assumed level of light around you).</li>
				<li>Select the type of photo you would like to take:</li>
					<ul>
					<li>Selfie</li>
					<li>Group Selfie.</li>
					<li>Landscape.</li>
					<li>Landscape with an individual.</li>
					<li>Landscape with a feature.</li>
					<li>Night photography.</li>
					<li>Action photography.</li>
					<li>Astronomy photography.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Take an example photo that will help analyse the environment and photo setting from database of photos.</li>
				<li>The app searches through its database and returns at least five similar results of photographs that match selected criteria.</li>
				<li>From the returned results, select a photograph that best represents how you would like the photo to turn out.</li>
				<li>The app displays the settings on the screen in order for you to change them on your camera.</li>
				<li>Adjust settings manually on the camera.</li>
				<li>Take an improved photo as per the settings.</li>
				<li>Provide feedback on your result within in the app so the algorithms can be improved.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Future plans for this application can be adding camera manufacturer and the model to help you find where the settings are found for specific adjustments on the camera. Adding lens settings could also be an option as a lens can vastly increase the and decrease the quality of photos. Also adding a specific database of photos that you may have a preference to instead of using the provided data. When selecting your own specific list, you must ensure that all the correct data would be added in the settings. The application would only be able to find the photo and return the settings based on user input. The application could also be expanded to select from a detailed list of photographers based on your preference, however this would require a collaboration from multiple specialist photographers in the industry.  This application would also have a heavy focus on asking the consumer if they are happy for the developers to use the settings input within the app and the settings they have provided on photo selection to improve the app.</p>
			<p>As this application would be Android or IOS it would be available to most with a mobile phone. With regard to software, there are currently many programs that you can use to code Android and IOS on. While I have done limited research on mobile development tools available it appears that there are many to fit every type of application you may with the produce. You could also host a simple database server with photos as the actual size and quality would not have to be the highest as the end user would only be using them to compare to the current environment.(Mobile Application developement tools, n.d.)</p>
			<p>If this project was successful, amateur and hobby photographers would be able to greatly improve their skills and understanding of how DSLRs work and how to get the most out of their very expensive piece of technology. It would also help them understand terminology used by professional photographers. Lastly it would ensure they could see the results of their changes firsthand and this would ensure they would understand what each change would actually achieve. This software could also help professionals compare their own photography style with other professionals and help them not only improve but also understand their differences.</p>
